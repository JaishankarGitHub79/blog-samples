blog-samples
============

Source code for many of the tutorials in my JRoller blog listed at http://www.jroller.com/gmazza/entry/blog_article_index

After downloading, regardless of sample you will be working with, be sure to first run "mvn clean install" from the root folder to ensure the required parent POM (blog-samples-1.0-SNAPSHOT.pom) will be installed in your local Maven repository.
